Inspiration:

Create a website using a map of Seattle as its primary user interface. Designed to provide hisotrical information in a way that connects users more vividly to the contemporary city. My hope is that this website would be used by students, scholars, tourists, or simply curious local residents. The website would also provide information and links to underlooked or contemporary businesses and organizations nearby the important historical sites it highlights. I have drawn inspiration from several sources, including Laura Pulido, Laura Barraclough, and Wendy Cheng's "A People's Guide to Los Angeles" and the "Not For Tourists" guidebook series.


Already completed:

1) Supply basic html and css framework 

2) Load map from Google Maps API


Still to do:

3) Style map using a JavaScript style array - the below should provide "GrayScale" styling, but I have not yet been able to get this to work:

[
    {
        "featureType": "landscape",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "saturation": -100
            },
            {
                "lightness": 65
            },
            {
                "visibility": "on"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "poi",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "saturation": -100
            },
            {
                "lightness": 51
            },
            {
                "visibility": "simplified"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "road.highway",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "saturation": -100
            },
            {
                "visibility": "simplified"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "road.arterial",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "saturation": -100
            },
            {
                "lightness": 30
            },
            {
                "visibility": "on"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "road.local",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "saturation": -100
            },
            {
                "lightness": 40
            },
            {
                "visibility": "on"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "transit",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "saturation": -100
            },
            {
                "visibility": "simplified"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "administrative.province",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "visibility": "off"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "water",
        "elementType": "labels",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "visibility": "on"
            },
            {
                "lightness": -25
            },
            {
                "saturation": -100
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "featureType": "water",
        "elementType": "geometry",
        "stylers": [
            {
                "hue": "#ffff00"
            },
            {
                "lightness": -25
            },
            {
                "saturation": -97
            }
        ]
    }


4) Identify important historical location on map with pins 
Not sure how to do this yet - use Google Maps API?


5) Create jQuery event handler to change map based on clicks on nav elements at bottom of main page

e.g. $("#category").click(function() {
	//change pins on map
	//change map color/styling(?)
});


6) Create event handler that creates pop-up screens with historical and contemporary info connected to pinned locations

e.g. $("#pins").click(function(){
	//show pop-up window with historical/contemporary info
	//provide links to other cool local businesses
});
