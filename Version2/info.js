      'During the 1930s, one of the largest examples of Depression-era squatter camps known as "Hoovervilles" existed on a site adjacent to what today is Century Link field. Most of its residents were single men--unemployed lumberjacks, fishermen, farmworkers, miners, and seamen. Its residents survived by fishing, collecting driftwood, salvaging junk , and performing odd jobs. While the 1930s squatter settlement pictured below was unprecedented in its size, similar makeshift itinerant worker settlements had existed in the in the Elliot Bay tideflats and Duwamish river banks for much of Seattle\'s history. The Seattle Housing Authority\'s forcible destruction of Hooverville\'s in 1942--ostensibly to accomodate wartime mobilization priorities--was indicative of a broader decline of such settlements. Marginal settlement patterns continued to exist on a diminished scale after World War II, finding expression in houseboat communities on Lake Union and along the Duwamish River. However, rising land values and changing land use patterns mean that today even these settlements have largely disappeared.</p>'+

	  'When white settlers originally arrived in Seattle during the 1850s, a ridge of hills separated Elliot Bay from Lake Washington. The hills defining this ridge began their ascent at the water’s edge, making travel and building on the site very difficult. During the next 60 years, much of this ridge was flattened, the excess dirt used to create Seattle’s waterfront. For example, today’s Western Avenue and Alaskan Way sit on land that was once part of Elliot Bay. The picture on the right depicts the Denny Regrade, the last and most ambitious regarding project the city undertook. The regrade targeted Denny Hill, which once covered the neighborhood of Belltown. Its architects originally hoped the regarded land would become lucrative real estate, but the Great Depression damaged these dreams. The area instead became a low-rent district until the 1990s, when Seattle’s technology boom gentrified almost overnight what had been a district of vacant lots, seedy bars, and pay-by-the-hour hotels.</p>'+

      'The idea for building a large domed stadium in Seattle first surfaced in 1959. After Seattle was granted a MLB franchise in 1967 (the Pilots), King County voters approved bonds in 1968 that would pay for such a facility. While the Pilots ultimately relocated to Milwaukee after just one season, Seattle subsequently received an NFL franchise in 1974 (the Seahawks, to begin playing in 1976) and a replacement MLB franchise in 1976 (the Mariners). Completed in 1976, the Kingdome would serve as the home for both franchises until its demolition in 2000. Financially, the stadium was a failure. By the 1990s, the owners of both the Mariners and Seahawks believed the revenue it generated to be inadequate; the bonds initially authorized to pay for the stadium in 1968 are still being paid off in 2015. Further, the stadium suffered from structural problems, most clearly manifested by a partial roof collapse in 1994. That said, many Seattle sports fans remember the venue with nostalgia. The Kingdome could be very loud and difficult to play in for visiting teams, the noise it generated serving as the origin for the famed Seahawks “12th man.” Once derided as an eyesore, its ugliness has now become a piece of nostalgic 1970s kitsch in the eyes of many.</p>' +

Sick constructed the stadium for the Rainiers, who would play at the site until 1968. In 1969, Seattle\'s first Major League franchise, the Pilots, would locate at the stadium. However, the stadium proved inadequate as a venue for professional baseball. Partly as a result of the staidum\'s inadequacy, the Pilots stay in Seattle would be remarkably brief. The franchise would relocate to Milwaukee as the Brewers prior to the 1970 season. In relative disrepair, the stadium would once again serve as the home for the minor league Rainiers from 1972 to 1976. Sick\'s Stadium was finally demolished in 1976.

      'In 1853, Henry Yesler founded a sawmill to transform the nearby forests into timber. Yesler\'s business was critical to Seattle\'s development, as it\'s ability to produce timber on an industrial scale distinguished the new Euro-American settlement from competing logging camps and farming communtiies established throughout Western Washington at the time. Most of timber was exported to California, linking Seattle to a broader national economy from its inception. Because of the large number of young male workers it attracted, the sawmill also served as the locus for Seattle\'s first vice district. This district became known as "Skid Row" for the way logs were skidded down the hillside nearby to the sawmill on the waterfront. Over time, "Skid Row" became a generic name given to similar vice district throughout the world. Yesler\'s enterprise was also notable in that it made full use of the surrounding Native communities in its operation. Yesler himself married a Duwamish woman and fought against the removal of Natives to reservations.

The store was located on Weller Street in Nihonmichi, or “Japantown,” a bustling neighborhood of 8,500 that served as the hub of Japanese immigrant life in Seattle. The Higo 10 Cent Store provided a range of Japanese household goods for the Japanese immigrant community, but also attracted an increasingly white customer base intrigued by the store’s “exoticism.” The store proved so popular that it moved to the two-story Jackson Building, where it eventually occupied nine storefronts between 602 and 608 South Jackson Street. Like other Japanese-Americans, the Murakamis were forcibly relocated to an internment camp in 1942 as a result of Executive Order 9066. However, unlike many other Japanese-American business owners, the Murakamis were able to re-open their business when World War II ended. The (now) Higo Variety Store would remain open until 2003, when Masa Murakami (Sanzo and Matsuyo’s daughter) chose to close the business. However, the Higo storefront remains and the location today houses Kobo, a Japanese-inspired art gallery and craft store.

      'Since the 19th century, the Duwamish River has served as a central location for industrial activity in Seattle. The river’s channel was straightened and dredged to allow for ocean going vessels to navigate its waters and service the marine terminals and industrial facilities on its banks. During the 20th century, numerous manufacturing facilities sited their operations in the vicinity. Because of a lack of regulation and limited scientific awareness, these facilities polluted the river with a wide array of chemical runoff. As a result, the United State Environmental Protection Agency declared the five mile stretch of the river flowing into Elliot Bay a Superfund site in 2000. In 2014, the city of Seattle, King County, the Port of Seattle, and the Boeing Company agreed to fund a $342 million clean-up. As the recently-taken photograph to the right indicates, the lower Duwamish River remains an important location for heavy industry and, as a result, an arena of contentious regulatory struggle between environmentalists and businesses.</p>'+

      'The piers at Smith Cove (today, the Port of Seattle\'s Terminal 91) have been central to Seattle\'s economic development since the late 19th century. Initially, the area was the site for the terminus of James. J Hill\'s Great Northern Railway. The Japanese Company Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) used several piers at the main port of call for the first regular steamship service between the Asia and the Pacific Coast of North America. However, for much of the 20th century, the Smith Cover piers were dominated by the United States Navy. The site was the location of an important 253-acre naval supply depot during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Smith Cove\'s intertwined history of military provisioning and international trade came together in particular during the Vietnam War era. The United States Armed Services became convinced that shipping military equipment in standardized 20 foot and 40 foot containers was highly efficient. However, the shipping lines charged with supplying the military equipment did not like carrying paying cargo on only the western Pacific crossing. As a result, companies like Matson and Sea-Land began to stop in Japan on their way back from Vietnam to pick up manufactured goods. While the Smith Cove piers would ultimately be used more for oil trans-shipment and fishing than for containerized cargo, their role in as staging ground for container shipping during the Vietnam War was an important founding moment in the globalization of the American economy.</p>'+

The city of Seattle purchased the land after it was surplused by the federal government in 1971. Discovery Park was officially established in 1973. However, its creation was highly controversial. Regional Native American groups were angered city officials ignored their requests to open a cultural center on the surplussed land. Led by Bernie Whitebear (of the Colville Confederated tribes in eastern Washingotn), the Native groups argued that a series of 19th century treaties granted surplus military lands to their original owners (in this case, Native Americans). As a result, the United Indians of All Tribes (UIAT)--some of whose members had been involved in a similar, more famous occupation of San Francisco’s Alcatraz Island in 1969—-occupied the now-decommissioned Ft. Lawton for three months in 1970. Their action led to the creation of Daybreak Star Cultural Center in 1971, which still operates today. The events around Discovery Park’s creation are particularly notable for the key role in the Native American civil rights or “Red Power” movement. Discovery Park’s creation is also an example of Seattle’s transition away from the military-industrial economy that had been so central to the city’s (and the Puget Sound region’s) growth for most of the 20th century.</p>'+

      'In response to the housing shortage generated by population growth during World War II, Yesler Terrace was inaugurated as Washington State’s first public housing development in 1941. Yesler Terrace was remarkable for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was the first racially-integrated public housing development in the United States, containing a mixture of White, Asian, and African American residents. Secondly, unlike most other public housing built at the time, Yesler Terrace consisted of single-family two-story row houses with private yards. Finally, unlike many other housing developments to fulfill wartime needs, Yesler Terrace remained a desirable place to live in the years after the war.  Further, the community remained racially integrated. As of 2005, its population was 40% Asian or Asian American, 38% African or African American, 11% White, and 3% Native American. In 2012, the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) received permission to completely redevelop Yesler Terrace, replacing the existing housing stock with more units designed to serve a mixture of income levels.

      'Today, Lake Washington is one of the Seattle area\'s premier recreational and environmental amenities. However, this has not always been the case. The City of Seattle had used the lake as an outlet for treated sewage since the early 20th century. But as suburban communities surrounding Lake Washington grew rapidly in the years following World War II, the lake’s water quality declined to the point where it became a regional crisis. While the sewage sent into the lake had been treated, chemicals left in the runoff altered its ecosystem. By the 1950s, Lake Washington’s surface was covered in blue-green algae, which caused its fish population to decline. During the summer, masses of dead algae accumulated on the shore causing the lake to generate an unpleasant odor. It was frequently closed to public use (see image on the right). As a result, politicians and scientists pushed for a new municipal authority (Metro) to redirect the sewage runoff into the Duwamish River in order to restore Lake Washington’s water quality. The new sewage processing system Metro created and managed was highly successful, and Lake Washington’s water quality was restored by the 1970s.

      'Growing out of the 1971 Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg decision, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts had the discretion to implement mandatory busing to implement racial integration of school districts throughout the United States. While the scope of this ruling was ultimately reduced by the subsequent 1974 Milliken vs. Bradley decision, many school districts implemented busing programs to achieve school desegregation during the 1970s and 1980s. Seattle maintained one the nation’s longest running school busing programs between 1977 and 1999. Although the city’s population largely opposed the program (as evidenced by the results of 1978 referendum later ruled unconstitutional), it persisted without the kind of acrimony seen in other parts of the country. This was likely the result of a combination of factors, including the city’s liberalism, its relatively small African American population, and because affluent white parents were able to find ways around the program. Even so, by the late 1980s  the busing plan was largely seen as a failed experiment, even amongst many of those who were initially supporters. Because many white students were able to avoid the program’s effects, the burden of integration largely fell on minority students (see the image above of African American students arriving at Roosevelt High School in Ravenna, sometime during the late 1970s). Minority test scores did not improve, and the perception grew that busing discouraged parental engagement. The program persisted in a modified form into the 1990s, but was largely killed off between 1997 and 1999 under the influence of then-superintendent of John Stanford, himself an African American. </p>'+

Scientists at the University of Washington\'s Medical School would have the distninction of creating the first viable means of providing treatment for those with chronic kidney failure. In 1960, Dr. Belding Scribner invented what became known as the "Scribner Shunt", a teflon tube designed to provide an efficient way of taking out toxic blood a patient\'s kidneys were failing to process and cleansing it externally. (See the image to the right from 1960 of Clyde Shields, the first person to receive the new dialysis treatment). At first, this new treatment could only be applied in a hospital, but subsequent advances made by Scribner\'s team during the 1960s allowed for home dialysis units as well. It is not an exaggeration to say that the University of Washington\'s innovations have saved and prolonged the lives of millions of people around the world. Prior to the 1960s, chronic kidney disease was a death sentence for those who had it. Now, such patients can expect to have a normal life expectancy.
