      'During the 1930s, one of the largest examples of the Depression-era squatter camps known as "Hoovervilles" existed on a site adjacent to what today is Century Link field. Most of its residents were single men--unemployed lumberjacks, fishermen, farmworkers miners, and seamen. Its residents survived by fishing, collecting driftwood, salvaging junk , and performing odd jobs. While the 1930s squatter settlement pictured below was unprecedented in its size, similar makeshift itinerant worker settlements had existed in the in the Elliot Bay tideflats and Duwamish river banks for much of Seattle\'s history. The Seattle Housing Authority\'s forcible destruction of Hooverville\'s in 1942--ostensibly to accomodate wartime mobilization priorities--was indicative of a broader decline of such settlements. Marginal settlement patterns continued to exist on a diminished scale after World War II, finding expression in houseboat communities on Lake Union and along the Duwamish River. However, rising land values and changing land use patterns mean that today even these settlements have largely disappeared.</p>'+

	  'When white settlers originally arrived in Seattle during the 1850s, a ridge of hills separated Elliot Bay from Lake Washington. The hills defining this ridge began their ascent at the water’s edge, making travel and building on the site very difficult. During the next 60 years, much of this ridge was flattened, the excess dirt used to create Seattle’s waterfront. For example, today’s Western Avenue and Alaskan Way sit on land that was once part of Elliot Bay. The picture on the right depicts the Denny Regrade, the last and most ambitious regarding project the city undertook. The regrade targeted Denny Hill, which once covered the neighborhood of Belltown. Its architects originally hoped the regarded land would become lucrative real estate, but the Great Depression damaged these dreams. The area instead became a low-rent district until the 1990s, when Seattle’s technology boom gentrified almost overnight what had been a district of vacant lots, seedy bars, and pay-by-the-hour hotels.</p>'+

      'The idea for building a large domed stadium in Seattle first surfaced in 1959. After Seattle was granted a MLB franchise in 1967 (the Pilots), King County voters approved bonds in 1968 that would pay for such a facility. While the Pilots ultimately relocated to Milwaukee after just one season, Seattle subsequently received an NFL franchise in 1974 (the Seahawks, to begin playing in 1976) and a replacement MLB franchise in 1976 (the Mariners). Completed in 1976, the Kingdome would serve as the home for both franchises until its demolition in 2000. Financially, the stadium was a failure. By the 1990s, the owners of both the Mariners and Seahawks believed the revenue it generated to be inadequate; the bonds initially authorized to pay for the stadium in 1968 are still being paid off in 2015. Further, the stadium suffered from structural problems, most clearly manifested by a partial roof collapse in 1994. That said, many Seattle sports fans remember the venue with nostalgia. The Kingdome could be very loud and difficult to play in for visiting teams, the noise it generated serving as the origin for the famed Seahawks “12th man.” Once derided as an eyesore, its ugliness has now become a piece of nostalgic 1970s kitsch in the eyes of many.</p>' +

      'Located in the Mount Baker neighborhood at the corner McClellan Street and Rainier Avenue, Sick\'s Stadium first opened in 1938. The stadium was named after Emil Sick, owner of the nearby Rainier Brewing Company as well as the minor league baseball franchise, the Seattle Rainiers. Sick constructed the stadium for the Rainiers, who would play at the site until 1968. In 1969, Seattle\'s first Major League franchise, the Pilots, would locate at the stadium. However, the stadium proved inadequate as a venue for professional baseball. Partly as a result of the staidum\'s inadequacy, the Pilots stay in Seattle would be remarkably brief. The franchise would relocate to Milwaukee as the Brewers prior to the 1970 season. In relative disrepair, the stadium would once again serve as the home for the minor league Rainiers from 1972 to 1976. Sick\'s Stadium was finally demolished in 1976. Today, the site serves as a location for a Lowe\'s home improvement store. Above is a photograph of the stadium as it looked just prior to its demolition in 1976.</p>' +

      'In 1930, restraunteur Maxon Lester Graham opened Coon Chicken Inn at the intersection of Lake City Way and 85th Avenue NE. The restaurant used racist imagery as a means of evoking "southern authenticity", a cultural trope largely tolerated by white American at the time. The restaurant also served as a lightning rod for Seattle\'s growing African American community. Bolstered by the rapid expansion of the city\'s African American population during World War II, the Seattle NAACP and the Northwest Enterpirse (Seattle\'s African American newspaper) maintained a sustained campaign agains Coon Chicken Inn\'s racist imagery. Graham ultimately removed the "coon" imagery in 1949, rebranding his restaurant as G.I. Joe\'s Country Chicken Store. Nevertheless, Coon Chicken Inn\'s relative longevity demonstrate just how embeeded white supremacy was in the United State during the middle of the 20th century. The restaurant is pictured above: patrons would enter thorugh the mounth of the "coon head" on the left.</p>'+

      'In 1853, Henry Yesler founded a sawmill to process the nearby forests covering the hills surrounding Elliot Bay. Yesler\'s endeavour was critical to Seattle\'s development, as it\'s ability to produce timber at an industrial scale distinguished the new Euro-American settlement from competing logging camps and farming communtiies established throughout Western Washington at the time. Most of timber was exported to California, linking Seattle to a broader national economy from its inception. Because of the large number of young male workers it attracted, the sawmill also served as the locus for Seattle\'s first vice district. This district became known as "Skid Row" for the way logs were skidded down the hillside nearby to the sawmill on the waterfront. Over time, "Skid Row" became a generic name given to similar vice district throughout the world. Yesler\'s enterprise was also notable in that it made full use of the surrounding Native communities in its operation. Yesler himself married a Duwamish woman and fought against the removal of Natives to reservations. In the picture above, a group of Yesler\'s Native employees pose for a picture in front of the mill\'s cookhouse. </p>' +

      'In 1909, Japanese immigrants Sanzo and Matsuyo Murakami opened the Higo 10 Cent Store. The store was located on Weller Street in Nihonmichi, or “Japantown,” a bustling neighborhood of 8,500 that served as the hub of Japanese immigrant life in Seattle. The Higo 10 Cent Store provided a range of Japanese household goods for the Japanese immigrant community, but also attracted an increasingly white customer base intrigued by the store’s “exoticism.” The store proved so popular that it moved to the two-story Jackson Building, where it eventually occupied nine storefronts between 602 and 608 South Jackson Street. Like other Japanese-Americans, the Murakamis were forcibly relocated to an internment camp in 1942 as a result of Executive Order 9066. However, unlike many other Japanese-American business owners, the Murakamis were able to re-open their business when World War II ended. The (now) Higo Variety Store would remain open until 2003, when Masa Murakami (Sanzo and Matsuyo’s daughter) chose to close the business. However, the Higo storefront remains and the location today houses Kobo, a Japanese-inspired art gallery and craft store. Above is a photograph the store as it appeared in 1943, boarded up after the Murkakamis had been interned.</p>'+

      'As the name suggests, Boeing Plant 2 was the Boeing Company’s second manufacturing facility. Located less than a mile south of the company’s original factory on the Duwamish River, Boeing Plant 2 began operation in 1936. During World War II, it became one of the most important centers for airplane manufacturing in the United States. The facility focused on building B-17 bombers used extensively in the daylight bombing of German targets, of which it built 6,981 in total. After the war, the facility continued to build a mixture of military and civilian aircraft. However, by the 1980s, other more modern facilities in the Seattle area and beyond had rendered Plant 2 largely obsolete. The plant was demolished in 2010 and the site—-contaminated by years of heavy industrial use--is being restored as part of the EPA’s Duwamish Superfund clean-up.</p>' +

      'Since the 19th century, the Duwamish River has served as a central location for industrial activity in Seattle. The river’s channel was straightened and dredged to allow for ocean going vessels to navigate its waters and service the marine terminals and industrial facilities on its banks. During the 20th century, numerous manufacturing facilities sited their operations in the vicinity. Because of a lack of regulation and limited scientific awareness, these facilities polluted the river with a wide array of chemical runoff. As a result, the United State Environmental Protection Agency declared the five mile stretch of the river flowing into Elliot Bay a Superfund site in 2000. In 2014, the city of Seattle, King County, the Port of Seattle, and the Boeing Company agreed to fund a $342 million clean-up. As the recently-taken photograph to the right indicates, the lower Duwamish River remains an important location for heavy industry and, as a result, an arena of contentious regulatory struggle between environmentalists and businesses.</p>'+

      'Discovery Park is located at the site of what was once Ft. Lawton, which served as a United States Army base between 1900 and 1970. The city of Seattle purchased the land after it was surplused by the federal government in 1971. Discovery Park was officially established in 1973. However, its creation was highly controversial. Regional Native American groups were angered city officials ignored their requests to open a cultural center on the surplussed land. Led by Bernie Whitebear (of the Colville Confederated tribes in eastern Washingotn), the Native groups argued that a series of 19th century treaties granted surplus military lands to their original owners (in this case, Native Americans). As a result, the United Indians of All Tribes (UIAT)--some of whose members had been involved in a similar, more famous occupation of San Francisco’s Alcatraz Island in 1969—-occupied the now-decommissioned Ft. Lawton for three months in 1970. Their action led to the creation of Daybreak Star Cultural Center in 1971, which still operates today. The events around Discovery Park’s creation are particularly notable for the key role in the Native American civil rights or “Red Power” movement. Discovery Park’s creation is also an example of Seattle’s transition away from the military-industrial economy that had been so central to the city’s (and the Puget Sound region’s) growth for most of the 20th century.</p>'+

      'In response to the housing shortage generated by population growth during World War II, Yesler Terrace was inaugurated as Washington State’s first public housing development in 1941. Yesler Terrace was remarkable for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was the first racially-integrated public housing development in the United States, containing a mixture of White, Asian, and African American residents. Secondly, unlike most other public housing built at the time, Yesler Terrace consisted of single-family two-story row houses with private yards. Finally, unlike many other housing developments to fulfill wartime needs, Yesler Terrace remained a desirable place to live in the years after the war.  Further, the community remained racially integrated. As of 2005, its population was 40% Asian or Asian American, 38% African or African American, 11% White, and 3% Native American.  However, in 2012, the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) received permission to completely redevelop Yesler Terrace, replacing the existing housing stock with more units designed to serve a mixture of income levels. While much of the new housing will remain available to existing residents, the SHA’s plan is controversial for the way it entirely remodels what is already a well-functioning community.</p>'+
